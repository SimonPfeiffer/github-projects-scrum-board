# Example Scrum Board in Github Projects

This repository illustrates the use of Github Projects as a Scrum Board.

Scrum artefacts: 

- The **Backlog** and **Sprint Backlog** be found in the [Projects Board](https://github.com/SimonPfeiffer/github-projects-scrum-board/projects/1).
- A **Sprint** is represented as a [Milestone](https://github.com/SimonPfeiffer/github-projects-scrum-board/milestone/1). 
- **User Stories** are represented as Issues and **Epics** are represented as [Labels](https://github.com/SimonPfeiffer/github-projects-scrum-board/labels).
